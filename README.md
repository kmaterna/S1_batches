# S1_batches

This set of codes will help with Sentinel-1 batch processing. It will search the Sentinel-1 archive, download data, organize files, produce interferograms with GMTSAR, and perform other options. 

## Description

Disclaimer: Just use MintPy instead!  

I still use this library for basic things like searching the Sentinel-1 archive, reading GMTSAR and ISCE files into Python, and maybe doing a simple average, but for my future time series needs, I intend to switch to MintPy.

### Capabilities: 
* The scripts in Data_Search_and_Download will search through SciHub for Sentinel-1 images and make maps of image footprints and timing plots. You can optionally download all your search results too. 
* The scripts in the main directory perform batch processing for Sentinel-1. The driver is sentinel_driver.py and the controls are manipulated via a batch.config file
* The scripts in stacking_tools have an implementation of SBAS for stacked data
* Example config files are kept in the configs_and_setup directory

### Usage of Data Search Features: 
An example usage of the scripts to search the Sentinel-1 database is given here. The directory containing these scripts must be on your path. Type the name of each program by itself (with no arguments) to see a help menu.  If you want to download the .SAFE folders, you should have an ASF login. 
```bash
scihub_search_s1_data.sh
scihub_search_s1_data.sh -s 2015-01-01 -e 2020-07-01 -c -124/40.3 -d Descending -o 13
scihub_display_footprints.sh -i search_results.txt 
scihub_download_s1_sar.sh -i search_results.txt -u earthdatausername -p earthdatapassword
```
